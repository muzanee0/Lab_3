        <h2>Campus Life</h2>
        <p>My university life was very tiring and I had very enjoyable moments as well. I felt like it was an amazing ride, with ups and downs. I sometimes felt inspired to do something but also too tired to do anything. I also feel like I have grown so much throughout these years, learning a lot about my field of study. Time management is crucial to me because I also have a part-time job alongside my studies, so I have to ensure that I complete my assignments before going to work. Therefore, I think my campus life throughout these years has been very enjoyable, but I can't wait for it to end very soon.</p>
